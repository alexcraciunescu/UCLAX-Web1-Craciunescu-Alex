Recognizing the growing demand for multimedia content, this solution would be implemented  successfully by creating a dedicated video section on the home page, providing curated short video playlists, recommending personalized short video compilations, and embracing engagement through the comments sections.",

When it comes to meditation and mindfulness, there isn’t a one size fits all solution for users. Therefore, I developed and incorporated advanced personalization elements within the app to enhance customer satisfaction. My proposed design solution included a “Quick Select” feature to quickly select a meditation or exercise that fits the users personal need at any given moment, as well as, a “Shuffle” option that would leverage existing user data from within the app (favorites and recently listened to).",
